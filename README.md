# Clock Faces for IPS Tube Clocks

Files "ready to use" for the firmware of judge2005 can be found in the respective font folder under crop. Simply download the *.tar.gz and upload it in the web interface of the clock. All fonts have been tested with a NovelLife watch.

The folder "Better_Defaults" contains improved versions of the standard watch faces which are supplied with the judge2005 firmware. In most cases am/pm/colon images have been added and the watch face has been cleaned up
